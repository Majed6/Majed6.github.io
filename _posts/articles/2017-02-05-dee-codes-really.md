title: dee.codes ? Really?!
---
Hello there,

Welcome to my blog. Yes, dee.codes. The search for the perfect name has been long, as long as a month or more. From stupid names to desperate ones like &#8220;MyURLIs.cool.&#8221; To be honest that URL is satirically cool.

dee.codes was available when I took it. Availability is a big problem. Every time I think of an epic name, the name is taken. Until I came across &#8220;dee.codes&#8221; AKA the codes AKA decodes. That was enough for me. Rhymes with decoding and &#8220;the codes&#8221; which is kinda cool. As a bonus, it turned out that Dee (dÄ«) means good in Thai. I can&#8217;t ask for more. Good codes, the codes, and decodes sounds geeky enough.

At last, the website was named dee.codes. Now I had to name the blog. It wasn&#8217;t that difficult, from the get go Throughs(Blog) super geeky super cool. Thoughts(Blog) means casting my thoughts on the blog. Clearly, it&#8217;s not Blog(Thoughts) because I am casting my thoughts on the blog and not the blog shaping my thoughts.

Hahaha, I hope you enjoyed reading about the making of this blog. Until next time stay positive.
